## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **New to the project?** Start with [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)
2. **Comparing state management?** Read [STATE-MANAGEMENT-COMPARISON-2024.md](./STATE-MANAGEMENT-COMPARISON-2024.md)
3. **Running performance tests?** Follow [PERFORMANCE-TESTING-GUIDE.md](./PERFORMANCE-TESTING-GUIDE.md)

## üìä Key Findings (2024)

Based on comprehensive performance testing:

1. **Performance differences are minimal** (<1ms between implementations)
2. **Custom Hook** remains the best choice for this simple calculator
3. **Zustand** offers the best balance for scaling
4. **Redux Toolkit** is ideal for enterprise applications
5. **All implementations** are production-ready

## üîÑ Recent Updates

### January 2024
- Added comprehensive performance measurement system
- Created automated performance testing
- Extracted state management examples to feature modules
- Unified localStorage synchronization
- Added real-time performance comparison tools

### Architecture Improvements
- Feature-based folder structure
- Shared components and utilities
- Consistent TypeScript interfaces
- Cross-implementation synchronization
